# CSC 212 Programing Assignments

The following repository contains the solutions I came up for programing assignments assigned to me by the CSC 212 class at the University of Rhode Island. Title of the class is Data Structures and Algorithms. 

" CSC 212 introduces fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms, and their role in organizing and processing information efficiently. The course explores theoretical, implementation, and application aspects of important data structures and algorithms in use on modern computers. Particular emphasis is given to algorithms for sorting and searching. The course also covers basic concepts for analyzing space and time requirements of algorithms, critical for understanding their performance characteristics. `C/C++` will be used to implement data structures and algorithms in programming assignments and lab sessions.
